# push_swap

For this project I included a few other goals for me: learn some test-driven development and how to be less reliant on mouse. 

I started using IntelliJ Clion as IDE, but configured keymap to be as VSCode so going back and forth between IDEs don't bring me much trouble.

This the keybindings I kept note:

``alt + 1``: alternates between project and editor

``alt + Insert`` New... (file, directory, etc)
