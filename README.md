# Push_swap

The **Push_swap** project at 42 School challenges students to sort a stack of numbers using a limited set of operations. The goal is to achieve this with the fewest possible moves while focusing on efficiency and algorithmic optimization.

## Key Objectives

- **Sorting Two Stacks**:  
  - You are provided with two stacks:  
    - `A` (containing unsorted numbers).  
    - `B` (initially empty).  
  - The objective is to sort the numbers in stack `A` using stack `B` for auxiliary operations.

- **Operations**:  
  A limited set of operations is allowed to manipulate the stacks:  
  - `sa`, `sb`, `ss`: Swap the first two elements of a stack.  
  - `ra`, `rb`, `rr`: Rotate the stack (top element goes to the bottom).  
  - `rra`, `rrb`, `rrr`: Reverse rotate the stack (bottom element goes to the top).  
  - `pa`, `pb`: Push the top element from one stack to the other.

- **Efficiency**:  
  - The challenge is to sort the stack with the minimum number of operations.  
  - You must implement an optimized sorting algorithm, focusing on minimizing time complexity and operation count.

- **Algorithm Design**:  
  - Understanding of efficient sorting algorithms is key, including:  
    - Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Radix Sort, or a custom approach.  
  - The solution should handle different stack sizes efficiently (small and large sets).

## Learning Outcomes

- Enhance problem-solving skills through algorithm design.
- Improve proficiency in minimizing operations and optimizing time complexity.
- Gain a deeper understanding of data structures like stacks and how to manipulate them.
- Analyze and implement algorithms for optimal performance in various cases.

This project strengthens your grasp of sorting algorithms and algorithmic efficiency while emphasizing clean, optimized code.
